In February 2020, Arnold Gordon will turn 80!
To mark this momentous occasion we are hosting a workshop in celebration
of his innumerable contributions to physical oceanography.

**Date**: Feb 13-14, 2020

**Location**: [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](git@github.com:rabernat/alg-symposium.git), La Jolla, CA, USA

The workshop is timed to take place just before the
[2020 Ocean Sciences Meeting](https://www2.agu.org/ocean-sciences-meeting/),
in order to minimize participant travel and the associated carbon footprint.

In the coming months we will use this site to share information regarding
the scientific program and logistics. For now, we ask Arnold's colleagues
and collaborators to _please save the date!_

We are currently in the process of confirming invited speakers.

Organizing Committee:
- Ryan Abernathey (LDEO)
- Bruce Huber (LDEO)
- Janet Sprintall (SIO)
- Martin Visbeck (GEOMAR)
